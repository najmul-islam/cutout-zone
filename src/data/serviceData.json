This shadow has the transparency and depth between the subject best. but because of the lighting, this shadow may vary. </p> <p> Because of the Cut out the shadow also gets removed. Because in editing to get the best background we have to remove it. That is why after editing we have put additional shadow to the photo to make it more realistic and natural. </p> <h2>Reflection</h2> <p> it comes when we take photos on a reflective panel like glass or any shiny metal. You get the exact shadow reflection of the object that material that is reflection shadow. This technique has been used for displaying many jewelers or any shiny products. That kind of reflection looks good on the photo. </p> <img src='/service/Service-ShadowMaking-2-v2106.jpg' alt='Service-ShadowMaking-2-v2106' /> <h2>Drop shadow</h2> <p> It is a type of shadow in which we see more than one commerce sites to do product photography. This reflection comes naturally when you take a photo of anything by putting light exactly over it and the shadow it creates underneath that is the drop shadow. It looks like the product is floating over that shadow. It gives a good look in terms of product photography. </p> <h2>Castaway shadow</h2> <p> When we put lights on a subject usually, we see a slanted shadow on it. It sees on the back usually. That is called the castaway shadow. in terms of showing any bigger object using the castaway, the shadow is more natural-looking. That is people use this shadow on bigger objects. It looks more natural and eye-catchy too.

Now depending on the object, we decide which shadow to give, we have discussed before the type of shadows that are there. We use according to that which type of lighting effect will go with the photo and we put shadows according to that. </p> <p> Another time we use shadow to the photo when the background color gets matched with the product color. It conflicts with the product edge. That is why to separate the product from the photo we add shadows to it. It defines the product from the background and adds depth to the photo. </p> <p> Using the photo on the E-commerce site, while uploading photos on the E-commerce websites we have maintained the uniformity of the photo. To make the series of photo uniform we add shadows to it. The circle or box-shadow makes it work. It makes all the photos uniform and perfect for use on an E-commerce platform.
