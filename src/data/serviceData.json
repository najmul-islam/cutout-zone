Shadow creation is a visual effect that can be given by any editing software and you can get a more perfect natural shadow. </p> <p> Every photo has its own natural shadow but when taking photos in the studio the shadow doesn’t get clear and reflects well. Because of the background removal, the shadow gets removed too.

This shadow has the transparency and depth between the subject best. but because of the lighting, this shadow may vary. </p> <p> Because of the Cut out the shadow also gets removed. Because in editing to get the best background we have to remove it. That is why after editing we have put additional shadow to the photo to make it more realistic and natural. </p> <h4>Reflection</h4> <p> it comes when we take photos on a reflective panel like glass or any shiny metal. You get the exact shadow reflection of the object that material that is reflection shadow. This technique has been used for displaying many jewelers or any shiny products. That kind of reflection looks good on the photo. </p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ShadowMaking-2-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ShadowMaking-2-v2106' /> <h4>Drop shadow</h4> <p> It is a type of shadow in which we see more than one commerce sites to do product photography. This reflection comes naturally when you take a photo of anything by putting light exactly over it and the shadow it creates underneath that is the drop shadow. It looks like the product is floating over that shadow. It gives a good look in terms of product photography. </p> <h4>Castaway shadow</h4> <p> When we put lights on a subject usually, we see a slanted shadow on it. It sees on the back usually. That is called the castaway shadow. in terms of showing any bigger object using the castaway, the shadow is more natural-looking. That is people use this shadow on bigger objects. It looks more natural and eye-catchy too. Nobody usually gets that is added artificial shadow. </p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ShadowMaking-3-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ShadowMaking-3-v2106' /> <h2>Who needs an image shadow service?</h2> <p> Image shadow service is for those people who need to put photos on e-commerce sites and own shopping site. For getting a better click-through rate eye-catchy images have no alternative and to make the photo more eye-catchy you have added the shadow. </p> <p> And in human psychology, it is necessary to have something to watch and the picture do that. To make the purchase decision image plays a big role. To make the ad or your product listing more eye-catchy which picks attention, you have to make the picture look more natural. And after removing the background your photos look artificial? Then you need to take the image shadow service. </p> <p> In the photography industry, most of the time product photographers do this with photoshop to put various shadows on the photo. Very professional photographers add shadows to their photos artificially because in studio lighting, they do not get the expected result with the photo. </p> <h2>When to use shadow creating service?</h2> <p> After removing the background by using the clipping path the background of the image gets flats that is why to make it more natural and give depth to the photo, we have to add shadows. Now depending on the object, we decide which shadow to give, we have discussed before the type of shadows that are there. We use according to that which type of lighting effect will go with the photo and we put shadows according to that. </p> <p> Another time we use shadow to the photo when the background color gets matched with the product color. It conflicts with the product edge. That is why to separate the product from the photo we add shadows to it. It defines the product from the background and adds depth to the photo. </p> <p> Using the photo on the E-commerce site, while uploading photos on the E-commerce websites we have maintained the uniformity of the photo. To make the series of photo uniform we add shadows to it. The circle or box-shadow makes it work. It makes all the photos uniform and perfect for use on an E-commerce platform. Not only E-commerce on any type of product selling site this part is very crucial. </p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ShadowMaking-4-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ShadowMaking-4-v2106' /> <h2>How to add drop shadow?</h2> <p> We can put drop shadow using photoshop. Adding shadow to a photo means adding black and grey shapes surrounding the object, the effect must have to be subtle and precise otherwise it will look unnatural. </p> <h2>Advantages of adding a drop shadow</h2> <p> the main advantage of putting a drop shadow is it makes the photo look more natural. So when you remove the background from a product image then it looks very plain and unnatural there is nothing attention-seeking. But by adding the drop shadow gives a very natural and realistic feeling to the photo. </p> <p> An e-commerce website or any selling page where products get sold by only seeing the pictures, in this type of situation having the natural-looking realistic images are very important to gain the customer trust.

We provide all of them. Here just giving a small brief about them. Choose according to your need and let us know.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-Masking-2-v2106.webp' alt='Service-Masking-2-v2106' /> <h3>Photoshop Layer Masking</h3> <p>Photoshop layer masking is a common method of removing the background. It is the easiest way to do layer masking. If you want to remove a certain portion of an image then this thing usually gets in use. You have many more controls over it too. You can change the color of the selected layer and opacity too. In the masking tool selecting by the black brush tool, the background will get transparent.</p> <p>You can set the hardness and the opacity of the brush. The brush has got various moods too. You can set according to your need. The portion you select by brush will go transparent. Same as if you need to bring back any portion you just have to redo the brush pressing minus.</p> <h3>Alpha Channel Masking</h3> <p>This option of editing gives you a lot more options. It is different from the general type of masking. That is where this method comes in handy. Suppose you need the remove the background at the same time have to change the brightness and contrast of a particular photo then this method is a perfect method for you.</p> <p>Here you can change the brightness and contrast of the photo at the same time as well as remove the background. This particular method is a bit tricky too but for our professionals, it’s very easy. It makes the work process very fast and easy.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-Masking-3-v2106.webp' alt='Service-Masking-3-v2106' /> <h3>Hair Masking</h3> <p>Masking the hair part is very tricky. Because it has very thin edges that are hard to mask. but not for us, our professionals do not let go a single side of a hair. If you have had the thinnest line of hair, we also mask that. We do not let go of any detail. And to do this process clipping path won’t be enough. That is why here comes the hair masking method.</p> <p>If the image is not properly masked then it will look very weird because a certain portion of the hair will be missing so nobody wants that. That is why there is no alternative to having hair masking. And we do this perfectly for you.</p> <h2>Photoshop Refine Edge Masking</h2> <p>It is a common problem in photoshop that clipping the sharp edges is really hard and if once you get that it creates a problem later on using the photo on another background. To solve this problem, we use refine edge masking. It will help you to easily mask yourself with any background. You won’t face any problem with adjusting the background with them.</p> <p>This feature also gives you a fine tool option to work with critical edges too. This tool comes in very handy in a well lighten the photo. It keeps the color combination intact and doesn’t look weird while attach to any other background.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-Masking-4-v2106.webp' alt='Service-Masking-4-v2106'> <h2>Transparent Object Masking</h2> <p>This is another tricky masking. This masking process has been getting used in those photos where the background can be seen from the front. That means the object itself is transparent. In this kind of situation, just removing the background is not the solution. Because after removing the background the object will look different. After attaching with another background there will be no match.</p> <p>And the object we are talking about is glasses, water, jar, jug, car glass, and spectacles, etc. For this object, special masking is needed that is why our expert team does have the skill to remove the transparent object background too. So, after doing that whatever the background you attach will not be different from the transparent object. </p> <h2>Collage Masking</h2> <p>The college mask method has been vastly used in magazines, leaflets, brochures, etc. the primary purpose of the masking is to use more than two photos to look at them they are together, and also adding multiple photos objects to a single photo is done by college masking.</p> <p>Anything could be added here. By using different layers, we do this college masking process. In the college masking process, there is lots of room to add more objects to the photo. Also, according to the need, you can decorate the picture. But the concern is the lighting and the depth. keeping the realistic lighting and putting them in the right depth is kind of a challenge but our experienced team is an expert on them.</p> <h2>How to remove background by Photoshop</h2> <p>There are lots of ways available to make the background transparent in photoshop. We are sharing some of them which are easy to use. There are different situations to use them properly. All the methods are made for different reasons.</p> <h3>Background eraser tool</h3> <p>This tool is the widely used tool to remove the background. Lots of people use this tool to remove the background. This tool works fine with any photo and it is easy and fast too. the problem with this tool is the accuracy. In a photo where have thin lines there the tools get shorter. It cannot select the area and if can it is very difficult to get. </p> <h3>Selection tool</h3> <p>To remove the background using the selection tool is the easiest way to get the background separated. This tool automatically detects the object edge and select that. After using the transparent layer, you will get a transparent background with your photo. But this has the same issue with the accuracy. But the advantage is editors can have been various layers.</p> <h3>Brush tool</h3> <p>It is another popular way to mask any photo from the background. The brush tool uses black and grey color to directly use the masking process. It gives the user lot more option to edit. With the same tool, you can adjust many other options too.</p> <h2>Why us?</h2> <p>We are doing masking work for years now. And our highly skilled team is expert on their job.

You won’t get your desired result.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ECommerceImageSolution-1-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ECommerceImageSolution-1-v2106' /> <h2>Background removal</h2> <p>This is the most used and known service in terms of e-commerce photo editing. A plain background product photo gives you more clarity about the product and it removes destruction. If the photo has clattered and has different things in it it will distract the customers and you will lose them.</p> <p>That is why we put effort and remove the background precisely and also put a solid background that will complement the product color. It gives the essence of the photo and makes it more realistic. And also, you get the flexibility to use the photo with any background.</p> <h2>Mannequin effect</h2> <p>Hiring a model and trying them on with the cloth and taking photos might get costly sometimes. Also, to show off clothing it is more interesting to show that somebody is wearing it. And if you are using a mannequin to do that then with the mannequin the photo looks weird sometimes. That is why we are here. We will remove the mannequin part from the picture properly.</p> <p>To give you a clear idea we use the mannequin effect in photoshop. To have that effect you can check our article about that from here. We make the ghost mannequin effect. In general removing, you will see the back part of the cloth has been removed because of the mannequin removal. But we do not do that. We merge both of the parts so that they look more realistic and have a 3D effect on that.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ECommerceImageSolution-2-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ECommerceImageSolution-2-v2106' /> <h2>Photo shadow effect</h2> <p>This is also a vastly used effect in the e-commerce industry. It makes the product image more realistic and have them a proper look with it. It looks the product is floating. But putting the shadow realistic is a challenge. But we provide this smartly to make the photo look more realistic. Which is mandatory to generate more sales on e-commerce platforms.</p> <h2>Photo color correction</h2><p>This technique can save you a lot of money. In this service, we provide different colors for the same photo in photoshop. So, you don’t have to take multiple photos of your products to show all the color options. We can do this artificially in a perfect way. And that is how you get multiple color options generated from just a single photo.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ECommerceImageSolution-3-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ECommerceImageSolution-3-v2106' /> <h2>Product photo cleaning</h2> <p>This service uses mostly in jewelry editing. It is normal that in the product there is some dust and unnecessary thing could be there. But showing them in the image is not appropriate. Especially in close up the image, they get clearer. Which is distracting and does not convince the customer to purchase. That is why we do clean them in post.</p> <h2>Product image composition</h2> <p>You must have seen online ads using multiple photos together. So, our editor can do this as well. They will add multiple photos together and can create a really good concept image. This type of image mostly gets used in an advertisement in the e-commerce platform. We can keep any element from any photo and have them merged together to have a great combination.</p> <p>In e-commerce platform details matter a lot. Little flaws in a photo can be a huge issue later. But in terms of photo retouching, we have other services that you can access from here.</p> <img  height='190' width='380' src='/service/Service-ECommerceImageSolution-4-v2106.webp' alt='Service-ECommerceImageSolution-4-v2106' /> <h2>Why You Need an E-commerce photo editing Service?</h2> <p>The main reason for proving an e-commerce photo editing service is to raise your sales regularly.
